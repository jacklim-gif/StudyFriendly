# StudyFriendly ✨

**The gamified flashcard app that makes learning languages & skills feel like playing a game.**

A beautiful, modern, and completely open-source flashcard experience built for real learners who are tired of boring memorization tools.

StudyFriendly turns studying into an addictive game: flip cards → earn XP → level up → unlock new categories → watch your progress grow — all wrapped in a sleek dark cyberpunk/neon interface that looks incredible on any device.
