StudyFriendly – The gamified flashcard app that makes learning feel like playing
A beautiful, modern flashcard experience built for real language learners and skill-builders who are tired of boring memorization apps.
StudyFriendly turns studying into a game: flip cards, earn XP, level up, unlock categories, and watch your progress grow – all wrapped in a sleek dark interface with glowing cyan accents that looks incredible on any device.
What makes StudyFriendly special

Gamification that actually works – Earn +15 XP for mastering cards, +5 XP for practice. Every 100 XP = one level up. See your progress instantly.
15+ real-world categories – Travel, Daily Speaking, Interview, Workplace, Shopping, Food, Grammar, Academic English, Phone Calls, Directions, Email Writing, Slang, School, Malaysian Manglish, and more.
Malaysian Manglish deck – The first flashcard app with a full Manglish category – perfect for locals and learners who want to sound natural.
Smart progression system – Cards move between Easy → Normal → Hard levels based on how well you know them (Spaced Repetition lite).
Persistent progress – XP, levels, and mastered cards saved forever in localStorage (no account required).
Built-in AI Support Chat – Stuck? Confused? Need motivation? Just click the floating cyan button and chat with your personal AI tutor powered by GPT-4o-mini. It knows everything about the app and gives friendly, encouraging answers with emojis.
Stunning dark + neon design – Obsidian black background, glowing cyan highlights, smooth animations, custom scrollbars, and a cyberpunk-inspired aesthetic that makes studying feel cool.
Fully responsive – Looks and works perfectly on phone, tablet, and desktop.
No backend needed – Everything runs client-side except the optional AI chat (via Vercel serverless).
